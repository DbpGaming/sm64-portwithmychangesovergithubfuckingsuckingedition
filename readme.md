# Powerstar Engine
this is a modified version of sm64-port with some changes and patches pre-applied
currently it only does these few things

#### 1. odyssey and sunshine movement
	wall slide
	dive hop
	ground pound dive
	ground pound jump
	roll
	spin jump
	spin pound
	underwater ground pound

2. debug menu
3. extended level bounds
4. slope fix
5. ceiling fix
6. ground pounds in long jump
7. triple jumps do not need as much movement
8. red coin hud
9. 2 frame firsties
10. skip peach config
11. mario silhouette (doesn't work on pc currently)
#### 12. reonucam3
	right dpad for analog camera (should be changed to a bumper on pc port)
	tap dpad right to center the camera behind mario (same as above)
	dpad right plus joystick up to look over cliffs (also same as above)
	second controller right stick also is analog camera on emulator (this should work for pc-port controllers automatically but doesn't yet)
	down button to center to closest of 8 axis
	note most of these features don't work on courses with hardcoded cameras, so these won't be a thing in vanilla levels.

13. Non stop stars
14. Exit course while moving
15. shindou poles
16. clearram on startup
17. larger border on n64
